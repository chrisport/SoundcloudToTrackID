Email response from SoundCloud on this issue:
The developers have let me know that the problems you are having is
due to issues with RTMP. Currently certain content on SoundCloud is
using a secure streaming method called RTMP. To explain RTMP, even
if a track is set to public and streamable by the artist, if the artist
is under a major label, this label can further control those streaming
permissions. So, it looks like it should stream correctly, however it doesn't.
